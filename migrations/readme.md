# Automated Upgrades

In an effort to make upgrading the protocol more accessible, here are some scripts to help in the deployment of new synthetic tokens to the Dollar Protocol ecosystem.

More scripts will be released to assist in the upgrade and verification of new protocol parameter designs soon.

## Notice: The current deploy script still needs some work to be fully useable. Make sure you read Open Zeppelin's docs on [upgrade-plugins](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins).
